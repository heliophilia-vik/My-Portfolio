# My-Portfolio
My first portfolio website 

This lading page was an exercise from the Odin Project course. 

Yeah, it was fun, but still a lot to practice and learn - I had fun and at the same time stressful days trying to complete this. 

Hope you enjoy the little sample music from my favorite playlist from Spotify.
